## üèóÔ∏è Rendering Strategy

This application demonstrates different rendering techniques optimized for e-commerce:

### Product Listing Page

- **Rendering Method**: Server Side Rendered (SSR)
- **Why SSR?**: Provides the data freshness.
- **Benefits**: Fast page loads, good SEO as content is server side rendered.


### Product Detail Pages

- **Rendering Method**: Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) with generateStaticParams
- **Revalidation**: Every 60 minutes
- **Why ISR?**: Product details change infrequently, and pre-rendering provides the fastest possible page loads while maintaining SEO benefits.
- **Static Path Generation**: Common product pages are pre-generated at build time using `generateStaticParams()`.
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Each product page has custom metadata generated from the product data for improved SEO.


### Cart Functionality

- **Rendering Method**: Client-side with React Context
- **Why Client-side?**: Cart state is user-specific and requires interactivity.
- **Persistence**: LocalStorage for store products.

## üñºÔ∏è Image Optimization Techniques

Special attention was given to image optimization to prevent layout shifts and improve Core Web Vitals:

1. **Placeholder System**: Skeleton placeholders shown during image loading
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Opacity transitions when images load
3. **Responsive Sizing**: Proper image sizing with the Next.js Image component


## üîß Installation and Setup

```


4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


## üöÄ Performance Considerations

- **ISR for Static Content**: Pre-rendered pages served from the edge
- **Client-side Interactivity**: Dynamic features like cart management run on the client
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with proper sizing and loading states
- **Metadata Optimization**: Dynamic metadata for better SEO


## üîç SEO Optimizations

- **Server-rendered Content**: All product data is pre-rendered for search engines
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Each product has custom title, description, and OpenGraph images
- **Performance Metrics**: Optimized Core Web Vitals for better search ranking
